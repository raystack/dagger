# Introduction

Dagger or Data Aggregator is an easy-to-use, configuration over code, cloud-native framework built on top of Apache Flink
for stateful processing of data. With Dagger, you don't need to write custom applications or complicated code to process
data as a stream. Instead, you can write SQL queries and UDFs to do the processing and analysis on streaming data.

## Key Features

Discover why to use Dagger

- **Processing:** Dagger can transform, aggregate, join and enrich streaming data, both real-time and historical.
- **Scale:** Dagger scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally for high performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
- **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to dagger with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones. Use Kafka and/or Parquet Files as stream sources.
- **Flexibility:** Add custom business logic in form of plugins \(UDFs, Transformers, Preprocessors and Post Processors\) independent of the core logic.
- **Metrics:** Always know whatâ€™s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](./reference/metrics.md) of throughput, response times, errors and more.
