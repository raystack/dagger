# Pre Processors

Pre processors enable the users to add Flink [operators/transformations](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/stream/operators) before passing on the stream to the SQL query. Each stream registered on dagger can have chained pre processors. They will run and transform the data before SQL processing.

# Type of Preprocessors

Currently, there is only one type of pre-processor.

- [Transformers](../guides/use_transformer.md)

# Data flow in preprocessors

![](/img/pre-processor.png)

In the above diagram:

- Data is getting ingested from two different streams.
- The `InvalidRecordFilterTransformer` is applied on both the streams in order to filter out invalid records.
- Then the filtered records are passed to further operators.
- Data is finally pushed to sink.

# Configuration

Following variables need to be configured as part of [PROCESSOR_PREPROCESSOR_CONFIG](../reference/configuration.md#processor_preprocessor_config) JSON

## `table_transformers`

A list of transformer configs.

- Example value: `[{"table_name": "testtable","transformers": [{"transformation_class": "InvalidRecordFilterTransformer"}]}]`
- Type: `required`

## `table_name`

Table name for the transformer.

- Example value: `testtable`
- Type: `required`

## `transformers`

List of transformers per table.

- Example value: `[{"transformation_class": "InvalidRecordFilterTransformer"}]`
- Type: `required`

## `transformation_class`

Fully qualified name of the class to be used for transformation.

- Example value: `"InvalidRecordFilterTransformer"`
- Type: `required`

## `transformation_arguments`

A key-value map required for parameters required for the custom transformation class.

- Example value: `{"table_name": "testtable"}`
- Type: `optional`

# Sample config

```properties
FLINK_SQL_QUERY = "SELECT data_1, data_2, event_timestamp from data_stream"
PROCESSOR_PREPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_PREPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "table_transformers": [{
    "table_name": "data_stream",
    "transformers": [{
      "transformation_class": "InvalidRecordFilterTransformer"
    }]
  }]
}
```
