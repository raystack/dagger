# Post Processors

Post Processors give the capability to do custom stream processing after the SQL processing is performed. Complex transformation, enrichment & aggregation use cases are difficult to execute & maintain using SQL. Post Processors solve this problem through code and/or configuration. This can be used to enrich the stream from external sources (HTTP, ElasticSearch, PostgresDB, GRPC), enhance data points using function or query and transform through user-defined code.

All the post processors mentioned in this doc can be applied in a sequential manner, which enables you to get information from multiple different external data sources and apply as many transformers as required. The output of one processor will be the input for the other and the final result will be pushed to the configured sink.

# Flow of Execution

In the flow of Post Processors, all types of processors viz; External Post Processors, Internal Post Processors and Transformers can be applied sequentially via config. The output of one Post Processor will be the input of the next one. The input SQL is executed first before any of the Post Processors and the Post Processors run only on the output of the SQL. Here is an example of a simple use case that can be solved using Post Processor and sample Data flow Diagrams for that.

- Let's assume that you want to find cashback given for a particular order number from an external API endpoint. You can use an [HTTP external post-processor](post_processor.md#http) for this. Here is a basic Data flow diagram.

![](/img/external-http-post-processor.png)

- In the above example, assume you also want to output the information of customer_id and amount which are fields from input proto. [Internal Post Processor](post_processor.md#internal-post-processor) can be used for selecting these fields from the input stream.

![](/img/external-internal-post-processor.png)

- After getting customer_id, amount and cashback amount, you may want to round off the cashback amount. For this, you can write a custom [transformer](../guides/use_transformer.md) which is a simple Java Flink Map function to calculate the round-off amount.

  **Note:** All the above processors are chained sequentially on the output of the previous processor. The order of execution is determined via the order provided in JSON config.

# Types of Post Processors

There are three types of Post Processors :

- [External Post Processor](post_processor.md#external-post-processor)
- [Internal Post Processor](post_processor.md#internal-post-processor)
- [Transformers](post_processor.md#transformers)

Post Processors are entirely configuration driven. All the Post Processor related configs should be configured as part of [PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG](../reference/configuration.md#processor_postprocessor_config) JSON under Settings in Dagger creation flow. Multiple Post Processors can be combined in the same configuration and applied to a single Dagger.

## External Post Processor

External Post Processor is the one that connects to an external data source to fetch data in an async manner and perform enrichment of the stream message. These kinds of Post Processors use Flink’s API for asynchronous I/O with external data stores. For more details on Flink’s Async I/O find the doc [here](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/stream/operators/asyncio.html).

Currently, we are supporting four external sources.

- [Elasticsearch](post_processor.md#elasticsearch)
- [HTTP](post_processor.md#http)
- [Postgres](post_processor.md#postgres)
- [GRPC](post_processor.md#grpc)

### **Elasticsearch**

This allows you to enrich your data stream with the data on any remote [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). For example, let's say you have payment transaction logs in the input stream but user profile information in Elasticsearch, then you can use this post processor to get the profile information in each record.

#### Workflow

On applying only this post processor, dagger will perform the following operations on a single message in happy path

- Consume the message from configured Kafka stream.
- Apply the SQL query configured.
- Generate the endpoint URL using [endpoint_pattern](post_processor.md#endpoint_pattern) and [endpoint_variables](post_processor.md#endpoint_variables).
- Make the Elasticsearch call.
- Read the response from Elasticsearch and populate the message according to [output_mapping](post_processor.md#output_mapping).
- Push the enriched message to configured sink.

#### Configuration

Following variables need to be configured as part of [PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG](../reference/configuration.md#processor_postprocessor_config) JSON

##### `host`

IP(s) of the nodes/haproxy.

- Example value: `localhost`
- Type: `required`

##### `port`

Port exposed for the same.

- Example value: `9200`
- Type: `required`

##### `user`

Username for Elasticsearch.

- Example value: `testuser`
- Type: `optional`

##### `password`

Password for Elasticsearch.

- Example value: `test`
- Type: `optional`

##### `endpoint_pattern`

String template for the endpoint. This will be appended to the host to create the final URL.

- Example value: `/customers/customer/%s`
- Type: `required`

##### `endpoint_variables`

Comma-separated list of variables used for populating identifiers in endpoint_pattern.

- Example value: `customer_id`
- Type: `optional`

##### `retain_response_type`

If true it will not cast the response from ES to output proto schema. The default behaviour is to cast the response to the output proto schema.

- Example value: `false`
- Type: `optional`
- Default value: `false`

##### `retry_timeout`

Timeout between request retries in ms.

- Example value: `5000`
- Type: `required`

##### `socket_timeout`

The time waiting for data after establishing the connection in ms; maximum time of inactivity between two data packets.

- Example value: `6000`
- Type: `required`

##### `connect_timeout`

The timeout value for ES client in ms.

- Example value: `5000`
- Type: `required`

##### `capacity`

This parameter(Async I/O capacity) defines how many max asynchronous requests may be in progress at the same time.

- Example value: `30`
- Type: `required`

##### `output_mapping`

Mapping of fields in output Protos goes here. Based on which part of the response data to use, you can configure the path, and output message fields will be populated accordingly. You can use [JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) to select fields from json response.

- Example value: `{"customer_profile":{ "path":"$._source"}}`
- Type: `required`

##### `fail_on_errors`

A flag for deciding whether the job should fail on encountering errors or not. If set false the job won’t fail and enrich with empty fields otherwise the job will fail.

- Example value: `false`
- Type: `optional`
- Default value: `false`

##### `metric_id`

Identifier tag for metrics for every post processor applied. If not given it will use indexes of post processors in the JSON config.

- Example value: `test_id`
- Type: `optional`

#### Sample Query

You can select the fields that you want to get from the input stream or you want to use for making the request.

```SQL
SELECT customer_id from `booking`
```

#### Sample Configuration

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "external_source": {
    "es": [
      {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "9200",
        "endpoint_pattern": "/customers/customer/%s",
        "endpoint_variables": "customer_id",
        "retry_timeout": "5000",
        "socket_timeout": "6000",
        "stream_timeout": "5000",
        "connect_timeout": "5000",
        "capacity": "30",
        "output_mapping": {
          "customer_profile": {
            "path": "$._source"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** Though it is subjective to a lot of factors like data in ES, throughput in Kafka, size of ES cluster. A good thumb of rule is to make index call rather than queries to ES for fetching the data.

### **HTTP**

HTTP Post Processor connects to an external API endpoint and does enrichment based on data from the response of the API call. Currently, we support POST, PUT and GET verbs for the API call.

#### Workflow

On applying only this post processor, dagger will perform the following operations on a single message in happy path

- Consume the message from configured Kafka stream.

- Example value: `{"key": "%s"}`
- Type: `optional`

##### `header_variables`

- Example value: `false`
- Type: `optional`
- Default value: `false`

##### `output_mapping`

Mapping for all the fields we need to populate from the API response providing a path to fetch the required field from the response body. You can use [JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) to select fields from json response.

- Example value: `{"customer_profile":{ "path":"$._source"}}`
- Type: `required`

##### `metric_id`

Identifier tag for metrics for every post processor applied. If not given it will use indexes of post processors in the JSON config.

```SQL
SELECT customer_id from `booking`
```

#### Sample Configuration for GET

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "external_source": {
    "http": [

        "verb": "get",
        "request_pattern": "/customers/customer/%s",
        "request_variables": "customer_id",
        "header_pattern": "{\"Header_Key\": \"%s\"}",
        "header_variables": "wallet_id",
        "stream_timeout": "5000",
        "connect_timeout": "5000",
        "fail_on_errors": "false",
        "capacity": "30",
        "headers": {
          "content-type": "application/json"
        },
        "output_mapping": {
          "customer_profile": {
            "path": "$._source"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** In case you want to use all the fields along with a modified/nested field you can use “select \*, modified_field as custom_column_name from data_stream”.

#### Sample Configuration for POST

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "external_source": {
    "http": [
      {
        "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1/customer",
        "verb": "post",
        "request_pattern": "{'key': \"%s\"}",
        "request_variables": "customer_id",
        "stream_timeout": "5000",
        "connect_timeout": "5000",
        "fail_on_errors": "false",
        "capacity": "30",
        "headers": {
          "content-type": "application/json"
        },
        "output_mapping": {
          "test_field": {
            "path": "$._source"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** Post request patterns support both primitive and complex data types. But for complex objects, you need to remove the quotes from the selector ( `%s`). So in the case of a primitive datapoint of string the selector will be (`”%s”`) whereas for complex fields it will be (`%s`).

### **Postgres**

This allows you to enrich your data stream with the data on any remote [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org). For example, let's say you have payment transaction logs in the input stream but user profile information in Postgres, then you can use this post processor to get the profile information in each record. Currently, we support enrichment from PostgresDB queries that result in a single row from DB.

#### Workflow

On applying only this post processor, dagger will perform the following operations on a single message in happy path

- Consume the message from configured Kafka stream.
- Apply the SQL query configured.
- Generate the Postgres query using [query_pattern](post_processor.md#query_pattern) and [query_variables](post_processor.md#query_variables).
- Make the Postgres call.
- Read the response from Postgres and populate the message according to [output_mapping](post_processor.md#output_mapping-2).

##### `capacity`

This parameter(Async I/O capacity) defines how many max asynchronous requests may be in progress at the same time.

- Example value: `30`
- Type: `required`

##### `retain_response_type`

If true it will not cast the response from Postgres Query to output proto schema. The default behaviour is to cast the response to the output proto schema.

- Example value: `false`
- Type: `optional`
- Default value: `false`

##### `output_mapping`

Mapping of fields in output proto goes here. Based on which part of the response data to use, you can configure the path, and output message fields will be populated accordingly.

- Example value: `{"customer_email": "email","customer_phone": "phone”}`
- Type: `required`

##### `metric_id`

Identifier tag for metrics for every post processor applied. If not given it will use indexes of post processors in the JSON config.

- Example value: `test_id`
- Type: `optional`

#### Sample Query

You can select the fields that you want to get from the input stream or you want to use for making the request.

```SQL
SELECT customer_id from `booking`
```

#### Sample Configuration

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "external_source": {
    "pg": [
      {
        "host": "http://127.0.0.1",
        "port": "5432",

        },
        "fail_on_errors": "true"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** If you want to use % as a special character in your Postgres query, you’ll need to provide an additional % with it as an escape character so that Java doesn’t take it as a string formatter and try to format it, which in turn might end up in invalid format exception.
E.g. "select email, phone from public.customers where name like '%%smith'"

**Note:** Please add relevant indexing in the database to ensure adequate performance.

### **GRPC**

This enables you to enrich the input streams with any information available via remote [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server.

## Internal Post Processor

In order to enhance output with data that doesn’t need an external data store, you can use this configuration. At present, we support 3 types.

- **SQL**: Data fields from the SQL query output. You could either use a specific field or `*` for all the fields. In case of selecting `*` you have the option to either map all fields to single output field or multiple output fields with the same name. Check the example in [sample configuration](post_processor.md#sample-configurations).
- **Constant**: Constant value without any transformation.
- **Function**: Predefined functions (in Dagger) which will be evaluated at the time of event processing. At present, we support only the following 2 functions:
  1. `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, which can be used to populate the latest timestamp.
  2. `JSON_PAYLOAD`, which can be used to get the entire incoming proto message as a JSON string. For this function to work correctly, ensure that the Dagger SQL outputs rows in the same format as the proto class specified in `internal_processor_config` field (check the function example in [sample configuration](post_processor.md#sample-configurations)).

### Workflow

On applying only this post processor, dagger will perform the following operations on a single message in happy path

- Consume the message from configured Kafka stream.
- Apply the SQL query configured.
- Populate the provided [output_field](post_processor.md#output_field) with the [value](post_processor.md#value) depending upon the [type](post_processor.md#type).
- Push the populated message to configured sink.

### Configuration

Following variables need to be configured as part of [PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG](../reference/configuration.md#processor_postprocessor_config) JSON

#### `output_field`

The field in output proto where this field should be populated.

- Example value: `event_timestamp`
- Type: `required`

#### `value`

The input data.

- Example value: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- Type: `required`

#### `type`

The type of internal post processor. This could be ‘SQL’, ‘constant’ or ‘function’ as explained above.

- Example value: `function`
- Type: `required`

#### `internal_processor_config`

The configuration argument needed to specify inputs for certain function type internal post processors. As of now, this is only required for `JSON_PAYLOAD` internal post processor.

- Example value: `{"schema_proto_class": "io.odpf.dagger.consumer.TestBookingLogMessage"}`
- Type: `optional`

### Sample Query

You can select the fields that you want to get from the input stream or you want to use for making the request.

```SQL
SELECT * from `booking`
```

### Sample Configurations

**SQL**

This configuration will populate field `booking_log` with all the input fields selected in the SQL

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "internal_source": [
    {
      "output_field": "booking_log",
      "type": "sql",
      "value": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

In order to select all fields and map them to multiple fields with same name in the output proto

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "internal_source": [
    {
      "output_field": "*",
      "type": "sql",
      "value": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Constant**

This configuration will populate field `s2id_level` with value 13 for all the events

```properties
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "internal_source": [
    {
      "output_field": "s2id_level",
      "type": "constant",
      "value": "13"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Function**

This configuration will populate field `event_timestamp` with a timestamp of when the event is processed.
```properties
FLINK_SQL_QUERY=SELECT * from data_stream
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "internal_source": [
    {
      "output_field": "event_timestamp",
      "type": "function",
      "value": "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    }
  ]
}
```

Similarly, the following configuration will fill the `json_payload` field with the complete output of SQL query, in JSON format.

```properties
FLINK_SQL_QUERY=SELECT * from data_stream
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_ENABLE = true
PROCESSOR_POSTPROCESSOR_CONFIG = {
  "internal_source": [
    {
      "output_field": "json_payload",
      "type": "function",
      "value": "JSON_PAYLOAD",
      "internal_processor_config": {
        "schema_proto_class": "io.odpf.dagger.consumer.TestBookingLogMessage"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Transformers

Transformers are the type of processors that let users define more complex processing capabilities by writing custom Java code. As this is a vast topic, we have covered it in detail [here](../guides/use_transformer.md).

# Post Processor requirements

Some basic information you need to know before the creation of a Post Processor Dagger is as follow

## Number of Post Processors

Any number of post processors can be chained in a single dagger for a given use-case. The post-processors could be of the same or different type. The initial SQL do not depend on the number of Post Processors and you can simply start with selecting as many fields that are required for the final result as well as the Post Processors in the SQL.

## Throughput

The throughput depends on the input topic of Dagger and after SQL filtering, the enrichment store should be able to handle that load.

## Output Proto

The output proto should have all the fields that you want to output from the input stream as well as fields getting enriched from the Post Processor with the correct data type.

## Connectivity

The enrichment store should have connectivity to the Dagger deployment.
