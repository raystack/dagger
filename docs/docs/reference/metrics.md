# Metrics

[Will be updating it once the new metrics are onboard]

Service-level Indicators \(SLIs\) are the measurements used to calculate the performance for the goal. It is a direct measurement of a serviceâ€™s behaviour and helps us and the users to evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO. The metrics captured as part of SLI for Dagger are described below.

## Overview

Some of the most important metrics related to a dagger that gives you an overview of the current state of it.

### `Status`

- Status of the job on the cluster. Could be either of these three.
  `Stopped`: Current status is stopped
  `Started`: The dagger has restarted once or more during the selected time interval `Running`: The dagger is running fine for the duration selected

### `Runtime since last restart`

- The time that the job ran/running since the last restart.

### `Sink`

- The configured sink type for dagger. Can be Log/BigQuery/Kafka/Influx.

### `Full restarts`

- The total number of full restarts since this job was submitted.

### `Total downtime`

- For jobs currently in a restarting situation, the time elapsed during this outage. Returns 0 for running jobs.

### `Max kafka consumer lag`

- Returns the "recent cpu usage" for the Java Virtual Machine process. This value is a double in the \[0.0,1.0\] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0 are possible depending of the activities going on in the JVM process and the whole system. If the Java Virtual Machine recent CPU usage is not available, the method returns a negative value.
