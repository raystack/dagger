/* Flink requires that all objects which are needed to prepare the Job Graph should be serializable along with their
properties/fields. StatsDReporter and its fields are not serializable. Hence, in order to mitigate job graph creation
failure, we create a serializable interface around the reporter as below. This is a common idiom to make un-serializable
fields serializable in Java 8: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22808112 */
