Dagger or Data Aggregator is an easy-to-use, configuration over code, cloud-native framework built on top of Apache Flink
for stateful processing of data. With Dagger, you don't need to write custom applications or complicated code to process
data as a stream. Instead, you can write SQL queries and UDFs to do the processing and analysis on streaming data.

## Key Features

Discover why to use Dagger

- **Processing:** Dagger can transform, aggregate, join and enrich streaming data, both real-time and historical.
- **Scale:** Dagger scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally for high performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
- **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to dagger with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones. Use Kafka and/or Parquet Files as stream sources.
- **Flexibility:** Add custom business logic in form of plugins \(UDFs, Transformers, Preprocessors and Post Processors\) independent of the core logic.
- **Metrics:** Always know whatâ€™s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/reference/metrics) of throughput, response times, errors and more.

- Enrichment -> [Post Processors](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/advance/post_processor)
- Aggregation -> [SQL](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/table/sql.html), [UDFs](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/guides/use_udf)
- Masking -> [Hash Transformer](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/reference/transformers#HashTransformer)
- Deduplication -> [Deduplication Transformer](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/reference/transformers#DeDuplicationTransformer)
- Realtime long window processing -> [Longbow](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/advance/longbow)

## Running locally

Please follow this [Dagger Quickstart Guide](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/guides/quickstart) for setting up a local running Dagger consuming from Kafka or to set up a Docker Compose for Dagger.

**Note:** Sample configuration for running a basic dagger can be found [here](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/guides/create_dagger#common-configurations). For detailed configurations, refer [here](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/reference/configuration).

Find more detailed steps on local setup [here](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/guides/create_dagger).

## Running on cluster

Refer [here](https://raystack.github.io/dagger/docs/guides/deployment) for details regarding Dagger deployment.

## Running tests

```sh
# Running unit tests
$ ./gradlew clean test

# Run code quality checks
